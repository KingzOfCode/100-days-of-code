**Thoughts:**
- I have been following @CleverQazi on Twitter/Instagram.  I did a free live JavaScript challenge (they are starting it again on May 25th, 2020 - tell them Shayon sent you after you signup here: https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/) and then I enrolled in his program "Profit with JavaScript" (https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/java...). I will be building projects form the modules and the live coaching calls provided with the course. I will start a YouTube Vlog to post my daily progress and thoughts, I think this will help me with being accountable.

### Day 1: May 20, 2020 Wednesday (Day 1)

**Today's Progress**:
- I finished my homework from the live coaching call (Profit with Javascript Course).  I got stuck on a few things.  I wanted to change my font (google worked), my font color (google worked, but i still need to find out how to change it for certain text), and make the backgroung image transparent (google worked, but it made the whold trading card transparent instead of just the background image).

**Thoughts**:
- I felt pretty good today.  Learned a few things that i didn't intentionally mean to learn looking for solutions to other problems.  This project helped me get more fimiliar with GitHub too.
