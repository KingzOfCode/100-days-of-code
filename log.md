Thoughts:
- I have been following @CleverQazi on Twitter/Instagram.  I did a free live JavaScript challenge (they are starting it again on May 25th, 2020 - tell them Shayon sent you after you signup here: https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/) and then I enrolled in his program "Profit with JavaScript" (https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/java...). I will be building projects form the modules and the live coaching calls provided with the course. I will start a YouTube Vlog to post my daily progress and thoughts, I think this will help me with being accountable.
